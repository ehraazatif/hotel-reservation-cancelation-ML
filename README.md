Dataset is from Kaggle. Has data about various hotel reservations, and whether
or not those reservations were cancelled. After cleaning the data up a bit,
managed to get about 87% accuracy with a random forest. Tried 
using logistic regression first due to binary classificaion nature of target
feature, but after trying out different things, only manged to get up to
65%-70% accuracy. Have not tried KNN as of yet, which is another popular
classification model.
